     * Returns an `InetAddress` object encapsulating what is most likely the machine's LAN IP address.
     *
     * This method is intended for use as a replacement of JDK method [InetAddress.getLocalHost],
     * because that method is ambiguous on Linux systems.
     * Linux systems enumerate the loopback network interface the same way as
     * regular LAN network interfaces,
     * but the JDK `InetAddress.getLocalHost` method does not specify the algorithm used to
     * select the address returned under such circumstances,
     * and will often return the loopback address, which is not valid for network communication.
     * Details [here](https://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug?bug_id=4665037).
     *
     *
     * This method will scan all IP addresses on all network interfaces on the host machine,
     * to determine the IP address most likely to be the machine's LAN address.
     *
     * If the machine has multiple IP addresses,
     * this method prefers a site-local IP address (e.g. 192.168.x.x or 10.10.x.x, usually IPv4).
     * If the machine has one or more, it will return the first site-local address.
     * If the machine does not hold a site-local address,
     * this method will return simply the first non-loopback address found (IPv4 or IPv6).
     *
     *
     * If this method cannot find a non-loopback address using this selection algorithm,
     * it will fall back to returning the result of JDK method `InetAddress.getLocalHost`.
     *
     * @throws UnknownHostException If the LAN address of the machine cannot be found.
